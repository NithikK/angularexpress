        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>The United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, over $11,000 per person in
            2019. However, healthcare outcomes like life expectancy and infant mortality rates are worse than in other
            high-income countries.</p>
        <p>Healthcare is provided by a mix of public and private entities. The main public health programs are Medicare,
            which covers adults 65 and older and some younger people with disabilities, and Medicaid, which covers
            low-income individuals. Many Americans also get health insurance through their employers or buy it directly.
            About 9% are uninsured.</p>
        <p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare, was passed to expand access
            to health insurance coverage. It did this through mandates, subsidies, and insurance exchanges but remains
            controversial.</p>
        <p>The healthcare system is fragmented, with different insurance plans, provider networks, higher costs than
            other countries, and uneven access and quality of care. Costs keep rising much faster than inflation.</p>
        <p>Hospitals, doctors, pharmaceutical and device companies, insurers, and governments at federal, state and
            local levels all play major roles in the complex public-private healthcare sector.</p>
        <p>Current debates involve issues like coverage and costs, improving quality and outcomes, regulating insurers
            and drug prices, the opioid crisis, women's health, telemedicine and more. Major reforms have been proposed
            but there is no political consensus on solutions.</p>
